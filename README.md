# Basic-First-Person-Controller
Basic FPS Controller in Unity. A personal project I'm using to learn Unity that I decided to public. 
Gonna make it as polished and as basic as possible so in future projects I'm just gonna import it to get a quick FPS movement core.  

# TO-DO
- Basic Scenario, maybe?
- Check if all proper files are ignored in .gitignore
- Create the All-seing Eye
- Key to alternate mouse/gamepad or detect the last input
- Refactor code
