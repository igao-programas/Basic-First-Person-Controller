# Basic-First-Person-Controller
Basic FPS Controller in Unity. A personal project I'm using to learn Unity that I decided to public. 
Gonna make it as polished and as basic as possible so in future projects I'm just gonna import it to get a quick FPS movement core.  

# TO-DO
- Input Handler (to support both Keyboard and basic Gamepad Input). Create a Input Handler Class for it.
- Basic Scenario, maybe?
- Check if I should use a simpler 3D Render Pipeline (if so, create a new project)
- Check if all proper files are ignored in .gitignore
- Decide between GetAxis and GetAxisRaw
